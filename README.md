hello! So, this is Taste_it restaurants.

1) taste_itDb.php is the website's database So, first, we have to run this to create a database on our PC.
  - it creates a new database without any  Category, Products or Chefs So, add it to display on the website.

2) make sure your xampp is running using MySql and Apache server.

3) this folder should be in the c:/xampp/htdocs directory.

4) run the index.php page using this link http://localhost/Group_12/Views/index.php in your browser.

5) if there is any error occurs ==> drop taste_itDb database and run it again (step1)

6) the id and password for admin side dashboard is id= admin@example.com and pass= your_admin_password

7) if you face difficulty to go to admin side to user side please open this link one more time
