hello! So, this is Taste_it restaurants.

1) taste_itDb.php is the website's database So, first, we have to run this to create a database on our PC.
  - it creates a new database without any  Category, Products or Chefs So, add it to display on the website.

2) make sure your xampp is running using MySql and Apache server.

3) this folder should be in the c:/xampp/htdocs directory.

4) run the index.php page using this link http://localhost/Group 12/Views/index.php in your browser.
